📊 Data Visualization Project — Task 1
Internship @ SkillCraft Technology

📌 Project Overview
As part of my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology, I was assigned Task 1, which involved analyzing and visualizing population data of Indian cities from the cities_r2.csv dataset.

The goal of this task was to explore gender-based population distribution and overall city-wise demographics through clear and compelling visualizations.

📊 Visualizations
1️⃣ Bar Chart – Male vs Female Population
A grouped bar chart was created to compare male and female population across the top 10 most populous Indian cities.

This visualization provides:

A quick gender-based comparison

Insight into gender balance across urban regions

An understanding of which cities are highly populated

🟦 Male — 🔴 Female
✅ Easy comparison

2️⃣ Histogram – Population Distribution
A histogram was plotted to display the distribution of total population across all cities in the dataset.

This visualization shows:

-->  Which population ranges are most common

--> Whether the data is skewed toward larger or smaller cities

--> The general spread of population counts

📌 The histogram includes a density curve for better interpretation of the data distribution.

📍 This project demonstrates my progress and learning during the internship program. It represents my ability to work with datasets, derive insights, and present them in a meaningful way.
